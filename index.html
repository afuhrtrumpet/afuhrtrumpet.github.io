				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Ever since I was young, I have always been eager to discover, learn, and make components of the world around me.</p><p>
The first experience I had close to my field was the creation of a Pok√©mon fan website in 2005. I first created this website using a site builder, then moved to creating and understanding each of the components behind it, from HTML, CSS, and and a PHP-based content management system. Most of my learning at this time was from trial and examples - I rarely understood the exact theory behind my work. I was able to maintain and update this website with content for several years, garnering many visitors over its lifespan.</p><p>
A few years later in middle school, I was faced with the question many times of what I wanted to do as a career with not much of an answer. Thinking the idea of creating robots sounded interesting, I joined my school's FIRST Lego League robotics team and I was instantly hooked. It was here I discovered that I really enjoyed working as a team faced with the task of solving problems with no simple answer. That same year I was finally able to put a name to it: engineering.</p><p>
I went through my high school years with the goal of preparing myself for a college engineering curriculum and finding out my interests within the field of engineering. The computer science courses that I took throughout this period helped me greatly with the latter goal, and I soon found myself participating in programming competitions, exploring data structures and algorithms, learning new languages, and working on coding projects in my spare time. It was from this experience and my continued experience on my schools FIRST Robotics Competition team that I decided to study computer engineering, for its hybrid of both electronic and software design, both things that I had explored and found myself equally interested in.</p><p>
Meanwhile, I had also participated greatly in my high school's band program as a trumpet player. From when I started playing in 2006, I strived to improve and participate as much as I could in music, appearing in many different honor bands, national competitions, and all-state groups. Even though I am pursuing a program in music, I still participate in ensembles at OSU today and credit music for developing my work ethic and leadership abilities.</p><p>
At The Ohio State University thus far I have strived to learn everything I can both inside and outside of class. Currently I am enrolled in the Fundamentals of Engineering for Honors program, in which I have completed projects in the C programming and participated in multidisciniplinary labs with other students and will create a robot as part of a team in the coming semester. Outside of class, I am broadening my knowledge in both hardware and software by working on projects involving Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and various programming languages, participating in clubs such as the Open Source Club and Engineers for a Sustainable World, going to events such as the Ohio Linuxfest and the OSU hackathon. Next semester, I plan to also assist with research at OSU by developing ImageJ plugins for the Ohio State's medical imaging department.</p>
