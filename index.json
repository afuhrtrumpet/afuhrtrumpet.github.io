				"Just finished a semester at OSU, and with that I will begin further updating my website with some of the projects and experiences I have had during that time.",
				"First of all, I recently updated the website to be more SEO-friendly (and readable in terminal browsers!) through the use of <a href='https://github.com/techtribe/grunt-static-handlebars'>grunt-static-handlebars</a>. With this, I no longer need Angular to process my data, as it is compiled into a static HTML file from a Handlebars template. I will also be reworking the layout a bit to be a bit more mobile-friendly, among other things.",
				"This semester has been filled with incredibly valuable learning experiences and opportunities. Most importantly:<ul><li>Built a robot to manipulate a zen garden at the OSU hackathon. This project led to a much deeper research project I am involved in, where my same group is taking the design further to create a modular prototyping machine that will have 3D printing and laser cutting functions, among others. You can track the development of this machine at our <a href='https://github.com/projectzen/3-Axis-Prototyping-Machine'>Github</a> and <a href='https://projectzen.xyz/'>website</a>.</li><li>Began learning about and working with FPGAs. I first worked with FPGAs through my intro ECE lab, where we built an audio keyboard on an Altera DE2. From this, I began learning Verilog using a DE0 board, first implementing Pong with VGA signals. Currently, I am reconstructing the Rhythm Heaven minigame <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrCTHodtzb4'>Lockstep</a> entirely with hardware.</li><li>Continued work with the medical center to create a lightweight image viewer. For this, I am using Python 2, GTK, and Cairo. Currently, the basic image display and zoom functionality is working, and I am working on using Cairo to draw masks.</li><li>Began an internship with <a href='http://allrfriends.com/'>all R friends</a>, where I am working on adding and improving functions to their backend system. Currently, I have built an automated text message system for the caretakers to use.</li></ul>",
				"I also have some exciting future plans coming up. Next semester, I start work as a research assistant at the OSU ElectroScience Laboratory, and this summer, I will be working as a software engineering intern at Google as part of the AdMob team!"

				"Changed some design aspects of the site, added more projects, updated the bio. Basically everything I've been doing within the last few months.",
				"As of recently, I am at the end of a summer internship at BloomReach doing web development using their big data technologies. I had a great time working for the company and enjoyed experiencing startup culture, as well as the rest of the bay area! From many of the meetups, events, and hackathons I attended, I had a blast and enjoyed learning about new technologies as well as new ways to use the technologies I was already familiar with. I will definitely take my time here as motivation to bring myself towards greatness even further while at my second year of school.",

				"So the website looks a bit different now.",
				"I decided to switch from the old jQuery-UI based layout to one using Google's Polymer UI components and AngularJS. Polymer is definitely something new to me, but I learned it throughout last week and really enjoy the approach it takes in making web components modular, much like the old days of HTML, and can definitely see it being successful in the future. Right now some of the default components (like the top bar you see) can be a bit difficult to customize, but they are also using the flexbox layout system, which I am currently getting myself familiar with.",
				"With AngularJS, I am attempting to derive all of this site's content from JSON and loading it into the Polymer-based template I have created. I have a JSON format that works well so far, but it will be interesting to see if that continues to suit my needs--I may even implement a web editor for this in the future."

			"paragraphs": [
				"Ever since I was young, I have always been eager to discover, learn, and make components of the world around me.",
				"This started with the creation of a Pok√©mon fan website in 2005, involving HTML, CSS, and and a PHP-based content management system. Most of my learning at this time was from trial and examples - I rarely understood the exact theory behind my work. I was able to maintain and update this website with content for several years, garnering many visitors over its lifespan. Later on in middle school, I joined my school's FIRST Lego League robotics team and I was instantly hooked, and more importantly, I had finally discovered engineering.",
				"In high school, I developed my love for engineering even more, finding myself participating in programming competitions, exploring data structures and algorithms, learning new languages, and working on coding projects in my spare time, all while taking rigorous math and science classes. Based on my loves of programming and physics, as well as my participation on the high school robotics team, I decided to study computer engineering.",
				"Meanwhile, I had also participated greatly in my high school's band program as a trumpet player. From when I started playing in 2006, I strived to improve and participate as much as I could in music, appearing in many different honor bands, national competitions, and all-state groups. Even though I am not pursuing a program in music, I still participate in ensembles at OSU today and credit music for developing my work ethic and leadership abilities.",
				"At The Ohio State University thus far I learn everything I can both inside and outside of class. The first year involved being an active member of several engineering clubs, winning the Fundamentals of Engineering Honors robot competition, developing image processing plugins for the medical imaging department, and creating the prototype for a student-run startup, all while working on side projects to understand the fundamentals of web, microcontroller, and mobile development. The coming year promises even more exciting opportunities, and I can't wait to see what's in store.",
				"This past summer I found myself in Silicon Valley for the first time working an engineering internship at BloomReach. Out here, I have met many different types of people and found myself immersed in new technologies I had never heard of before, both inside and outside of work. The summer also included going to Maker Faire and participating in three hackathons, and as a result I am inspired to make even more of a difference in the world."

				"As a computer engineering student, I love working on any electronics projects I can get my hands on. Particularly I have worked on Arduino projects due to their accessibility, and have used this as a springboard to learn more advanced electronics concepts, such as 555 timers and the i2c protocol.",
				"I also have developed a passion and skill for web development over the past year. Upon learning about web frameworks such as Django and Meteor and new client-side libraries such as AngularJS and Polymer, I've worked on web projects frequently both on my own and at hackathons. I can see myself in the future possibly using these skills so also create the interfaces for IoT projects."

It provides two modes of control: anarchy (queue of commands) and democracy (popular voted command is used). In order to host this on Meteor's servers, PubNub was used to communicate between the Meteor server and a client server that is controlling the drone. The app was also demoed live at Meteor Devshop SF in July 2014."

				"I ran into several interesting challenges with this. Parsing songs with JSON was not the easiest task to do, and I was not initially able to do this with the existing libraries as of January, but used a new library that appeared several months later to parse JSON strings. Memory management was (and still is) also an issue--the program was mysteriously not running properly until I tried running it on an Arduino Mega. I may still look into ways to cut down on memory usage, but the variety of songs held in memory already make this difficult."

				"This project uses an Arduino to control both EL wire and an RGB (non-addressable) LED strip simultaneously. It also reads input from a potentiometer, two buttons, a PIR sensor, and displays text to an LCD screen. The wiring diagram is show below.",
				"The source code for each program can be found <a href = 'https://github.com/afuhrtrumpet/arduinochristmaslights'>here</a>.<br>",
				"The first program does not utilize the buttons or LCD. It gradually fades the LED strip through the entire color spectrum and blinks the EL wire in an interval specified by the position of the potentiometer. After doing this for a certain amount of time, both components shut off to save power. They are reactivated when the PIR sensor detects motion.",
				"The second program performs similarly to the first program, but at the start it asks the user to input a sequence of colors by twisting the potentiometer to specify levels of red, green, and blue. After each color has been entered, the user can hit the bottom button to add another color or the top button to finish and start the sequence. Then, the EL wire performs as described in the first program while the LED strip switches between the user-defined sequence of colors in the same time interval the EL wire blinks. Both lights shut off after a certain period of time to wait for motion. The user can also press the top button during the light sequence to enter a new sequence of colors.",
				"I had my fair share of problems and issues during the implementation of this project. Here are some of the ones I solved along the way:",
				"<ul><li>The diode on the Arduino burned off due to a short circuit of the 12V power required to light the LED strip. I discovered that the other end of the strip connectors were also wired to ground, causing the short circuit.</li><li>The Arduino could not supply the power required to control the LED strip or EL wire. To solve this, I used an relay to switch on and off the power of the 9V inverter to the EL wire and hooked a 12V power supply up to the Arduino and used N-channel MOSFETs to control the power.</li></ul>",
				"And some improvements that could still be made:",
				"<ul><li>Two potentiometers should be used: one to set the colors, and one to control the blink delay. In the current configuration, for example, if blue is set to 0 in the last color added and the user forgets to set the potentiometer back to a non-zero value, the blinking occurs faster than the relay can handle, causing a buzzing sound.</li><li>The option to have the LED strip fade could still exist, or an option to have the strip fade between colors could be added.</li><li>For some reason when setting colors, a low blue value makes the LED strip blink rapidly between a blue and non-blue color.</li><li>The relay used to control the EL wire is noisy. Alternate control methods could be looked into for this.</li></ul>"
