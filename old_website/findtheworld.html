	<h3>What is Find the World?</h3>
	<p>Find the World is a hide-and-seek type game for Google Maps.
	Inspired by the Google Maps April Fools' Day prank in 2014, it allows
	users to hide markers all around the world for others to find.</p>

<div id = "create">
	<h3>Creating a game</h3>
	<p>To start creating a game, select the first option, "Create a Game",
	in the app's main menu. This will take you to a map view. To add a
	marker, long click on the point where you want the marker to be and
	select "add a marker". This will take you to the menu shown below:
	<br><img src="images/findtheworld/createsettings.png"></br>
	Here, you can set the marker's name, whether to use the default image or
	a custom one, and the minimum map zoom at which the marker is visible.
	After clicking the create button, the marker should appear, and you can
	click on the marker again to edit or delete it. When you are ready to
	save the game, long click on the map, select the "Save Game" option,
	enter a filename (don't worry about an extension - it will be saved as
	yourname.zip), click the button.</p>
</div>
<div id = "play">
	<h3>Playing a game</h3>
	<p>To play a saved game, click the "Play Game" option at the main menu
	screen. Navigate the map to find all the available markers, and click
	on a marker when you see it to "find" it. The game is over when you
	have found all the markers, and from there you can choose to either
	restart the game or go back to the main menu. If you would like to add
	a game someone has sent to you, move it to the /hideandseek directory
	of your external storage, and then it will appear in the "Play Game"
	menu.</p>
</div>
<div id = "share">
	<h3>Sharing a game</h3>
	<p>Once you have created a game, it is likely you will want to have
	your friends play it, and for this purpose a share function is
	available. Just select it from the main menu, select the game you want
	to share, and a dialog box will show up with the options for sharing.</p>
</div>
<div id = "download">
	<h3>Downloading Images</h3>
	<p>There are two ways to download images: downloading "image packs" from
	the app's main menu, and downloading the images yourself and moving them
	to the app's directory. Currently the only "image pack" available is
	Pokemon, so to download that, select the option in the image download
	menu. To download other images for use. Just move them somewhere in the
	/hideandseek directory and then they will appear when adding a
	marker.</p>
